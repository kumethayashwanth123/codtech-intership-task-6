**Overview of the Code**
This code is a Q-learning algorithm implementation in Python using the OpenAI Gym library, specifically for the FrozenLake-v1 environment. Below is an overview of the key components and logic used in the code:

**Environment Setup:**

The environment is created using gym.make('FrozenLake-v1', is_slippery=True). This environment represents a 4x4 grid where the agent must navigate from the start to the goal while avoiding holes. The is_slippery=True parameter makes the environment stochastic, meaning the agent's movements may not always succeed as intended.
**Q-table Initialization**

The Q-table is initialized with zeros using np.zeros((state_size, action_size)). This table will store the expected utility (Q-values) for each state-action pair. The dimensions are determined by the number of states (state_size) and actions (action_size) available in the environment.
**Hyperparameters**

**learning_rate** Controls how much the new Q-value overrides the old value.
**discount_rate:** Determines the importance of future rewards.
**episodes:** The number of episodes for which the agent will train.
**max_steps:** The maximum number of steps allowed per episode.
**exploration_rate:** The initial probability of choosing a random action (exploration) versus choosing the best-known action (exploitation).
**exploration_decay_rate:** Controls how quickly the exploration rate decreases.
**Training the Agent:**

The agent is trained over a specified number of episodes. In each episode, the agent either explores the environment by taking random actions or exploits the Q-table by taking the action with the highest Q-value.
After each action, the Q-table is updated using the Bellman equation:

Q(s,a)=Q(s,a)+learning_rate×(reward+discount_rate×max a Q(s′,a)−Q(s,a))

The exploration rate decays over time, meaning the agent gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation.
**Evaluating the Agent:**

After training, the agent's performance is evaluated over 100 episodes. In each episode, the agent exploits the learned Q-values to navigate the environment.
The average reward over these evaluation episodes is calculated and printed, providing a measure of the agent's effectiveness.
**Conclusion**
This Q-learning approach is a fundamental example of reinforcement learning where the agent learns to make optimal decisions through trial and error. By balancing exploration and exploitation, the agent eventually learns a policy that maximizes its chances of successfully reaching the goal in the FrozenLake environment. The average reward obtained during evaluation reflects the effectiveness of the training process, and in a well-trained model, this average should be close to 1.0, indicating that the agent successfully reaches the goal in most episodes.
